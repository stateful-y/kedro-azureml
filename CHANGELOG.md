## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-04-01

This **minor release** includes 1 commit.


### Features

- `kedro azureml run -j <job>` command for running named jobs immediately on Azure ML. Supports `--dry-run` (preview), `--wait-for-completion` (CI blocking), and `--on-job-scheduled` (callback). by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)
- `kedro azureml schedule -j <job>` command for creating or updating persistent Azure ML schedules. Requires each job to have a schedule configured. Supports `--dry-run` (preview). by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)
- `kedro azureml compile -j <job>` for compiling named job pipelines to YAML. by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)
- `schedules` and `jobs` config sections with cron and recurrence triggers, pipeline filtering (`from_nodes`, `to_nodes`, `tags`, etc.), per-job display name, compute, and experiment name. by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)
- Named workspaces: `workspace` is now a dict of named workspace configs (with mandatory `__default__`). Jobs can reference a specific workspace via `workspace:` key. CLI `--workspace`/`-w` selects a workspace at run/schedule time. by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)
- Full kedro-mlflow compatibility: unified experiment naming via mlflow.yml, MLflow run tagging hook, and env var injection into Azure ML component jobs. by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)
- Support for Python 3.13. by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)
- Support factory-resolved datasets in the runner. by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)

### Refactoring

- Config restructure: the `azure:` top-level key is replaced by three flat sections -- `workspace`, `compute`, `execution`. `compute` and `workspace` are flat dicts keyed by name (with mandatory `__default__`). `experiment_name` moves into per-job config. The `temporary_storage` and `pipeline_data_passing` config sections are removed. by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)
- `kedro azureml run` is replaced by `kedro azureml run -j <job>` (immediate execution) and `kedro azureml schedule -j <job>` (persistent schedules). `kedro azureml compile` now requires `-j <job>`. `--subscription-id` replaced by `--workspace`. by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)
- Blob storage removal: `KedroAzureRunnerDataset`, `KedroAzureRunnerDistributedDataset`, `BlobStorageDataPassing`, `KedroAzureRunnerConfig`, and `runner_dataset.py` module deleted. Pipeline data passing via `AzureMLPipelineDataset` is now the only mode. by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)
- Removed `kedro azureml run` command and all its options (`--display-name`, `--compute-name`, `--experiment-name`, `-p`/`--pipeline`, `--wait-for-completion`, `--on-job-scheduled`). by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)
- Removed deprecated `docker` config section; environment configuration now uses `execution.environment`. by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)
- Removed deprecated SDK v1 dataset stubs (`AzureMLPandasDataset`, `AzureMLFileDataset`) and `v1_datasets` module. by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)
- Migrated project following the `stateful-y/python-package-copier` template. by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)
- `kedro azureml init` no longer accepts positional arguments or `--aml-env`. It generates `conf/base/azureml.yml` with placeholder values to be filled in manually. by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)

### Documentation

- Migrated documentation from Sphinx (RST) to MkDocs with Material theme. by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)
- Rewrote all documentation pages based on diataxis approach: getting started, user guide, API reference, and contributing guide. by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)
- Added NumPy-style docstrings to all public modules, classes, and functions (interrogate coverage at 100%). by [@gtauzin](https://github.com/gtauzin)
